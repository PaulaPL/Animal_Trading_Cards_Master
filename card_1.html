			<p>The temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described 
				in the standard as "kindly, friendly and confident". Golden Retrievers make good 
				family pets, particularly as they are patient with children. They are not "one-man 
				dogs" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those familiar to them.</p>
